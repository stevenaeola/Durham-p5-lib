# Programming-Summative

My code essentially draws a line on a canvas in various directions to create interesting patterns. The line is generated by using prime numbers to determine the length that it will be. These are below 13 to keep the lines sensibly lengthed. When the line changes direction, it instantly and randomly generates a line length. From this it can calculate the x and y coordinates as it has a direction and a length. These coordinates are stored in the x and y arrays as x1 and y1. After another change in direction, the new coordinates with be stored as x2 and y2 and so on. 

At each turn, depending on how many sides are selected, the line rotates clockwise to give it a new direction. When the number of sides is 4, for example, this will be a perpendicular rotation of 90 degrees creating rectangular shapes. Much like when the number of sides is 5, the angle of change will be 108 degrees.

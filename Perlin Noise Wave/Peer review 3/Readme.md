#  **Introduction**

> The coding is inspired by Robert S. Robbins' s **Atomic Symbol** from Openprocessing.
> The structure for the Atomic Symbol can be considered as three parts: **center point**, 
> **paths** and **electrons**. The center point is easy to understand. The paths are the traces for the electrons move along with.  Therefore, in order to create the paths, I had built some orbits which are empty inside and placed them together with certain angles and so that the strokes of them formed the paths.

# **Parameters**

> **x** and **y**:  they usually represent the left/right and up/down position
> **r**: radius
> **colour**: colour of the center point
> **w** and **h**: the width and height of an orbit


# **Functions**
> There are three functions in my coding:  **setup**, **draw** and **colour change**.
> Basically the setup function is just to set up the size of the canvas and define the center point.
> The draw function involved all the process of the **paths**' creation.
> Colour change is the necessary function of changing the colour of the center point.

Program has been changed from a rigid game to a more open and flexible asteroid field simulator - changes made were:

* Solid walls added with frictioned collisions
* Trail length is now controllable by way of a slider
* Cursor gravity is now controllable by way of a slider
* The cursor increases in size on collision with asteroids
* The cursor changes color on collision with asteroids, becoming the color of said asteroid
* Field size can be freely altered in the code with no ill effects
* Cursor gravity is dependent on the cursor being in the field
* Asteroids can be added by left clicking
* The initial and maximum number of asteroids can be altered in the code
* Code has been completely rewritten into a class-based approach still utilising p5.js

   - A `.js` file containing the relevant class definition
   - A `.html` file which uses the .js file and demonstrates its use
   - A `README.md` file which contains the documentation for the class
- Once everything is complete (including peer review) make a pull request from your forked repository to <https://github.com/stevenaeola/Durham-p5-lib>

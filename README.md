### Project Description 
- Choose one sketch from openproessing(link:https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/608665 and the licensehttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)
- Adapt it into a reusable component using two JavaScript classes.(see class ball.js and class balls.js files)
    - With lot of constructor
    - Get and set methods for properties
    - using p5 and `draw` method 
- Build an example page(see indexx.html file) with properties controlled by form controls
	



### Method
- transform the original JS project into two class files
- class balls.js contains the get_method and set_method of the parameters ,also setup and draw functions.
- class ball.js constains the properties of particles with constructors and two functions about moving and display. 
- With 5 parameters,and 4 of 5 are presented on the example web page(indexx.html),users can input values and make changes to the example.By using the JS DOM.
- The HTML example page linked two class files and the indexx.js with the power of Bootstrap lib and p5 lib 
- the indexx.js file with two functions of initial setup and draw, also the DOM.


###Explanination of example page
- see indexx.html file
- can do the interaction by moving and touch using mouse
- can change the parameters easily
- linked with the other three files
- using the p5 and bootstrap lib
